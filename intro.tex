\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-intro}

\Cyclus \citeme is the first truly agent-based \citeme fuel cycle simulator. 
New technologies, while exciting, often pose new and unforeseen challenges.
\Cyclus is no exception to this rule.  This paper answers the questions,
\emph{``What precisley is an agent in a fuel cycle context?''} and 
\emph{``What is the best way to program an agent?''}

A discrete time agent-based simulator is needed to sate the want for increased 
fuel cycle modeling fidelity. The genesis of \cyclus lies in the desire to 
treat mass balances as discrete, model facilities individually rather than as 
a fleet, and to be able to quantitatively compare the effects of changing the 
fidelity of the facilities themselves. These goals imply a large degree of 
sophistication on th part of the simulator infrastrucute.  Resource exchange
must be handled in a generic and dynamic way as oppossed to being hard coded 
for select commodities. Simulations must be inherently comparable, which involves 
storage infrastucture that is designed around this need. Agents must be able 
to communicate with one another and learn about the environment in which they 
exist. Agents must be able to be dynamically deployed and the set of 
availble agent models may not be collected until run time. Building and using such a
simulator, while difficult, is not nearly as sisyphean as it might seem. 

What sets fuel cycle simulation apart from traditional agent-based simulations 
is the high degree of agent specialization. Standard agent based simulators
are characterized by a very small number of types of agents, often only one and 
almost always less than five \citeme. The agent types are then specialized 
when they are instantiated \emph{in situ}. This model falls apart for the 
fuel cycle.  For example, it would be unwise to have a single facility model 
that represented both enrichment and reactors, called \code{EnrichmentOrReactor},
that decides via a switch how it behaves when it is deployed. It is much 
more natural to have two models, \code{Enrichment} and \code{Reactor}, 
that implement their own physic calculations independent of one another.

\Cyclus takes agent specialization along two separate axes. The first is 
that each agent is an \emph{entity} that determines its role in the 
fuel cycle. There are three kinds of entities: \emph{regions} which 
represent geographic and governemental concerns, \emph{instituions} 
which manage other agents, and \emph{facilities} that implement 
physics calcualations and are usually in charge or reasource management.

The other axis of agent specialization distinguishes between who 
writes the model, who sets up the model for potential use in a simulation,
and who actually deploys concrete representations of the model.
At the highest level are \emph{archetypes}, which are software implmemtations
of physical, chemical, economic, and political models and whose behavior
is paraemterizable. For example, a \code{Reactor} archetype may be 
parameterized by a target burnup. Authors of these highly reusable models 
are known as \emph{archetype developers}. Archetypes are in turn 
\emph{configured} into \emph{prototypes}. A prototype is a copy 
of the archetype but with all parameterizations set to concrete 
values. Hence, a \code{Reactor} with a burnup of 42 MWd/kg is a 
prototype. Configuration is often specified by the \cyclus user 
in the input file. Confuguration requires no underlying knowledge of 
how the archetype is implemented, though that often helps.
Finally, prototypes are copied and \emph{deployed} into the simulation 
and become \emph{agents}. This usage of the term `agent' to mean 
the \emph{in situ} object is consistent with other agent-based
liturature \citeme.  Agent creation happens exclusively via 
\cyclus itself; manual deployement of agents is not allowed.
Archetypes which wish to deploy agents must \emph{schedule} their building
and decomissioning.

Of the above, archetype development is certainly the most taxing.
Not only must physical models be determined, implemented, and 
validated, but this is also where agents interface with the 
\cyclus kernel itself. The dynamism of agent-based simulation 
coupled with the compulsion to have traditional simulator features 
such as restart engenders a complex interface with the kernel.
Archetype development would be much simplified if saving and 
loading from disk and comunicating with other agents were 
never a concern, though such a simlator would be of marginal use.
Due to these complexities archetype development in \cyclus
has historically been difficult. Obtaining a working archetype
that performed no physics calulations from scratch would 
take novice developers upwards of two weeks effort.  The complexities
that lead to such a high bar are emblamatic of, not just \cyclus
but, any agent-based fuel cycle simulator.

This paper describes the strategies and efforts, the interfaces
and implementations which considerably reduce the complexity  
an archetype developer must deal with directly. This has been 
found to reduce development effort for simple agents down to a couple 
of hours for novices. Expert archetype developers see further 
reductions down to a couple of minutes. This has has been acomplished 
without sacraficing an iota of simulation fidelity. Since such 
problems proliferate throughout all possible simulators in 
the \cyclus category, the methods found here apply beyond \cyclus.
Though such methods sometimes dive into the minutae of 
computer science and agent-based modeling, they are always implmenented
with the express goal of making fuel cycle simulaton 
simpler, easier, faster, more expressive, and validated.

This paper proceeds by first providing a more detailed motivation 
in \S \ref{sec-motive}. Then, \S \ref{sec-methods} describes 
methods and mindsets that are used to ease archetype development.
Some of these are high-level strategies. Others amount to 
software interfaces that have been painstakenly determined to 
provide the correct fuel cycle agent abstractions. 
\S \ref{sec-impl} describes the underlying algorithms and usages
for those methodolgies which also require concrete implmentations.
Lastly, \S \ref{sec-conc} provides final remarks and illustrates
potential future directions for \cyclus archetype development.
