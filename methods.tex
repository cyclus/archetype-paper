\section{Methods \& Strategies}
\label{sec-methods}

Archetype development can be a daunting task on its own. For this reason,
many fuel cycle simulators choose to supply only a limited set of
pre-built archetypes. This places the responsibility of creating an maintaining
the archetypes with the authors of the simulator.  When only pre-built archetypes are available, then this suite defines the scope
of all possible fuel cycles that a user can model. If the scope is not broad
enough for the needs of a user, then the simulator developer must expand the
scope or lose the user.  This can create a bottleneck because the number of users
may increase while the productivity of the simulation developer remains constant.

\Cyclus avoids such bottlenecks by empowering users to create and maintain
their own archetypes independent of the development timeline of the \cyclus
kernel. However, this modularity comes with its own costs. Being able to
plug in user-created archetypes implies an \gls{API} to which
the archetype conforms. This is an
additional burden to both nascent and experienced archetype developers that
does not affect the underlying behavior or physics. Rather, a large percentage of the
code for an archetype exists soley to satisfy the \cyclus \gls{API} and does not
impact the physics, economics, or other domain concerns being modeled.

To mitigate the difficulties of writing archetypes,
\cyclus must aid in overcoming the hurdle of interfacing with
kernel itself. Additionally, to the extent possible, \cyclus should
also provide tools that
ease the implementation of the physics and desired behavior.
A variety of strategies are used by \cyclus to ease archetype development:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Automatic Model Templating:}  By automatically
        inspecting and creating portions of archetypes, the overhead
        of adhering to the \cyclus \gls{API} is removed. This is performed
        via preprocessing archetypes and then applying limited code generation
        to the original model. Such activities also
        add limited reflection to the C++ models as needed, which is important
        for archetypes that wish to know about themselves.

    \item \textbf{Data Communication Protocol:} \Cyclus
        provides a common basis for archetypes to store and retrieve
        complex data in the database. This is achevied through the
        implementation of \Cyclus-specific type system.
        This alleviates the need for archetype
        developers to invent and implement custom persistence solutions.

    \item \textbf{Validation:} Archetypes use \gls{XML} schema to validate that
        their prototypes have been configured correctly.
        This ensures the users of an archetype are adhering to the contraints
        imposed by the developer.

    \item \textbf{Metadata Annotations:} Archetypes have a standard place to
        store and retrieve both pre-defined and arbitrary metadata.
        This allows for archetype developers to communicate relevant information
        to tools outside of \cyclus (such as a visualization tool).

    \item \textbf{Model Location:} \Cyclus has a packaging system for archetypes and
        libraries of archetypes. This provides a standard mechanism for
        searching for and locating models.
        Furthermore, all archetype developers can
        uniquely specify their own archetypes without the fear of overlapping
        names.  For example, two developers could each have a \texttt{Reactor}
        archetype, but they would exist in different packages and be
        disambiguated.

    \item \textbf{Markets are not Agents:} In an agent-based methodology,
        the mechanism for communication between agents is not an agent itself.
        Thus in \cyclus, market resolution was moved to be solely in the purview
        of kernel. In order to transfer resources, agents communicate
        in a well-defined way. Thus, archetype development need not
        include markets that specify how archetypes wish to communicate.

\end{itemize}

Though the above mechanisms are discussed with respect to \cyclus, they are
transferable to any agent-based modeling framework that requires modular agent
archetypes. The following subsections present greater detail regarding these
strategies.

\subsection{Automatic Model Templating}
\label{subsec-ppgc}

Every \cyclus archetype is required to implement the member functions
seen in Table \ref{req-api} and may optionally implement those seen in
Table \ref{opt-api}. Due to object orientation in
C++ and how \cyclus stores state, these member functions must be implemented directly
on the archetype itself. The implementation of these functions that archetypes
inherit from the \code{Agent} class is not and cannot be sufficient.

\begin{table}
\caption{Required Archetype Interface}
\label{req-api}
\begin{tabular}[p]{|lp{4in}|}
\hline
\textbf{Function} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
\code{InfileToDb()} & Reads the prototype in the input file (XML format)
                      and adds them to the initial startup database.\\
\hline
\code{InitFrom(Db)} & Initializes a new agent or prototype from the database.\\
\code{InitFrom(Agent)} & Initializes a new agent or prototype from another agent or
                         prototype.\\
\hline
\code{InitInv()} & Initializes any starting inventory buffers.\\
\hline
\code{Clone()} & Copies the current agent.\\
\hline
\code{Snapshot()} & Stores the current state of the agent in the database.\\
\hline
\code{SnapshotInv()} & Stores the current inventory buffers in the database.\\
\hline
\code{schema()} & Returns the schema that user input must validate against.\\
\hline
\code{annotations()} & Returns all metadata that is automatically gathered
                       and supplied by the archetype developer.\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{table}
\caption{Optional Archetype Interface}
\label{opt-api}
\begin{tabular}[p]{|lp{4in}|}
\hline
\textbf{Function} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
\code{Build()} & Called when the agent has been built.\\
\hline
\code{EnterNotify()} & Allows for the agent to register for services.\\
\hline
\code{BuildNotify()} & Informs when children of this agent have been built.\\
\hline
\code{DecomNotify()} & Informs when children of this agent are about to be
                       decommissioned.\\
\code{Decommission()} & Removes the agent from the simulatuon.\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Archetypes store state as public or private member variables
directly on the class.  For example, a \code{Reactor} archetype class
could have a burnup declared as `\code{double burnup};'. Not every agent has
a burnup (e.g., an enrichment facility) and so the \code{burnup} member
should not be part of \code{Agent}. Furthermore, archetypes are modularly
defined. Because \cyclus cannot know all possible field names
for all possible archetypes for all time, it can only react to how
archetypes are written. In a dynamic language, the \code{Agent}
superclass would still be able to to \emph{inspect} instances of its subclasses
to discover field names at runtime. Such introspection is called \emph{reflection}.
This would allow \code{Agent} to hold a single, generic implementation of each of the
member functions in Listing \ref{req-api}, relieving archetype developers from
having to implement them manually.

However, C++ lacks reflection. Neither \code{Agent} nor archetypes are allowed
to dynamically discover what their member variable names are at runtime.  This
implies that the archetype developer must explicitly code in the appropriate variable
names in the correct way for each of the nine required functions.  For instance,
the \code{Reactor} class must explicitly save the \code{burnup} member in the
\code{Snapshot()} function if \code{burnup} is to be saved to the database.
None of the nine required interfaces comes along automataically and minor typos
could cause large breakages. For example, misspelling \code{burnup} as \code{bunrup}
could cause the \code{Snapshot()} method to fail silently if it occured in the
wrong location.

Since implementing this part of the archetype interface is both highly
error-prone and
routine, it is ripe for automatic code generation. Code generation replaces the
tedious task of writing the required member functions with software that will
insert such member functions into an otherwise fully developed archetype.

The code generation strategy has some limitations.
First, it must be
performed to prior to compilation. Second, the
code generator must be provided with enough information about the archetype in
order to accurately create the function implementation. Third and finally, it
is desirable to keep archetypes in valid C++, rather than a special
code generation language created just for \cyclus.
Templating languages
such as Jinja \cite{ronacher2011jinja2} or any other variety of custom
solutions would allow for
expressive code generation. However, such template languages would be yet another
tool for the archetype developer to learn. This runs counter to the goal of
simplifying development.

The limitations above are all addressed through the use of a
\cyclus-aware preprocessor. The first stage of C/C++ compilation is the
C Prepocessor or \code{cpp} \cite{stallman1987c}. This tool is responsible for expanding
\code{#include} directives and implementing other \code{#} directives, such as
\code{#pragma}. It is executed
prior to any other stage of compilation (lexing, parsing, \emph{etc.}).
Importantly, the \code{#pragma} directive is skipped by \code{cpp} if it is not
recognized and the directive is passed though to further preprocessors or a C++
compiler. It is a
purposeful hook for other preprocessors to use and implement their own code generation.
If an alternative preprocessor only uses \code{#pragma} directives as its interface,
the developer will be able to write in pure C++ and reap the benefits
of an extra code-generation step.

However, all code generators must be supplied with sufficient information about
where and how to create the code. These tasks may also be accomplished through
the use of pragmas. To handle a suite of such utilities, a custom preprocessor
is needed.

Certain pragmas may be used to parse only the needed information
about an archetype, rather than parsing the entire class. For an archetype, the
member variables that are saved and loaded from its instances are the most important.
This is because they fully describe the state of an agent
at all points in the simulation. These member variables are known as \emph{state variables}.
To generate the appropriate input and output routines for an archetype, at a minimum, the names and C++ types
of all state variables must be known. The gathering of all these state variables is is
called \emph{state accumulation}.

Still, other pragmas denote where to insert automatically generated code into the
original file. This is the tedious
part of achetypes communicating with the \cyclus kernel. Specifically,
the member functions in Listing \ref{req-api} ought to be created and inserted
for the
archetype developer, avoiding entirely the need to write them by hand.

The \cyclus preprocessor, called \cycpp, handles all of the cyclus code generation
and state accumulation. This tool only recognizes directives that begin with \code{#pragma cyclus} so as to uniquely distinguish it from other preprocessors.
\cycpp performs three complete passes through archetype code:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Normalization of the source via the standard C preprocessor \code{cpp}
    \item Accumulation of state and other agent annotations from normalized code
    \item Code generation into original source
\end{enumerate}
Importantly, any preprocessor that adds reflection must make at
minimum two passes: discovery of what exists (state accumulation) and adding this
information back to the class (code generation). Single-pass preprocessors such
as the standard \code{cpp} utility are not sufficient to enable reflection because they
cannot guarantee that all relevant class information has been seen when code generation begins.
Thus, \cycpp includes these two passes plus an additional
initial pass to simplify state accumulation. Further passes could be added that
implement reflection onto the generated code itself, but this is often unnecessary.
Particularly in \cyclus, further passes would be excessive since the portions of the
\code{cyclus::Agent} interface that are generated are known ahead of time.

\cyclus-specific pragmas are broken up into two categories depending on whether
they are most relevant to the state accumulation or code generation steps. They
are denoted as \emph{annotation directives} and \emph{code generation directives},
respectively.

The \cycpp annotation interface has two main directives:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \code{#pragma cyclus var <dict>} - state variable annotation
    \item \code{#pragma cyclus note <dict>} - agent annotation or note
\end{itemize}
The state variable annotation is used on the line immediately above an archetype
member variable to declare it as a state variable. The note directive is used
anywhere in an archetype class declaration and applies to the archetype itself.
Both of these have a \code{<dict>} argument that is a Python dictionary. This
holds metadata about the state variable or the archetype. For example, a \code{flux}
state variable declaration is shown in Listing \ref{flux-pragma}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Flux State Variable Annotation}, label=flux-pragma]
#pragma cyclus var {"default": 42.0, "units": "n/cm2/s"}
double flux;
\end{lstlisting}

The code generation interface in its simplest form occurs via the \cyclus
prime directive, \code{#pragma cyclus}.  This expression will
generate the entire archetype interface and insert it in place of the pragma.
More fine-grained code generation may be used by passing additional arguments.
The signature for such targeted code generation may be seen in Listing \ref{targ-cg}.
The first argument is one of \code{decl}, \code{def}, or \code{impl} representing
interface declarations, definitions (the declaration and the implementation together),
or implementations (just the body without the declaration) of the archetype member
functions respectively. Lacking any further arguments, this will produce the desired code for
all of member functions in Listing \ref{req-api}.  Optionally, a member function
name in all lowercase (i.e., \code{inittodb} rather than \code{InitToDb}) may
be supplied to generate code for the given function alone.  Lastly, in
cases where \cycpp cannot determine the archetype to apply the code generation for,
such as in an implementation file (\code{*.cc} or \code{*.cpp}), the agent
class name may be provided as a final parameter.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Targeted Code Generation Directive Signatures},
                   label=targ-cg]
#pragma cyclus <decl|def|impl> [<func> [<agent>]]
\end{lstlisting}

When the annotation and code generation directives are combined and expanded with
\cycpp, agents become much simpler to write.
Archtype developers are then free to focus on their physics
or economics algorithms. The base \cyclus
infrastructure is largely removed from the concern of the archetype developer.
For example, a simple reactor model may be completely implemented as seen in
Listing \ref{rx-eg}. The barrier to creating new archetypes is much lower than
compared to the hundreds of lines of code that this would require without \cycpp.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Simple Reactor Archetype}, label=rx-eg]
class Reactor : public cyclus::Facility {
 public:
  Reactor(cyclus::Context* ctx) {};
  virtual ~Reactor() {};

  #pragma cyclus

 private:
  #pragma cyclus var {'default': 4e14, 'units': 'n/cm2/2'}
  double flux;

  #pragma cyclus var {'default': 1000, 'units': 'MWe'}
  float power;

  #pragma cyclus var {'doc': 'Are we operating?'}
  bool shutdown;
};
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Data Communication Protocol}

Related to the issue of how to snapshot and restart simulations is the issue of
what fundamental data types are allowed to be saved and loaded natively by the
simulation. For many physics simulators, primitive data types (i.e., \code{float},
\code{int}, and \code{string}) and arrays of these types are sufficient to
express and evaluate the underlying equations. This handful of types is small enough
that most simulators can handle them in an ad hoc manner. Furthermore, these types
often align with the structure of most databases, allowing for easy translation
between disk and memory.

Agent-based fuel cycle modeling, however, subsumes physical modeling frameworks.
The types of data that are needed to naturally express many fuel cycle concepts
do not fit into the standard `arrays of floats' mindset.  More sophisticated types are needed,
such as maps and sets of primitive types. For example,
a reprocessing facility needs to have a mapping from elements to separation
efficiencies. To avoid hard-coding the elements into the archetype, the user should
be able to state which elements are allowed for each separation. The correct data
type in C++ for such information is \code{std::map<int, double>}. Any other
representation, say an \code{int array} or a \code{float array},  would likely be converted to
a \code{map} by the archetype itself.

\Cyclus increases expressiveness of archetypes and reduces error from extraneous
transcription by natively supporting its own extensible type system. Every type
has its own unique integer identifier as well as
a variable name corresponding to this type.
The types of the state variables are given by corresponding C++ representations.
Every database format may then choose which types in the type system it
supports and how it implements them. All types have a static \emph{rank}, or the
number of variable length dimensions, they support.  For example, \code{int} and
\code{double} are both rank-0, while \code{vector<float>} is rank-1 due to
vectors having arbitrary length. As an optimization, the archetype developer
may also give a \emph{shape}, or the maximum size along each dimension.
The type system is extensible,
allowing for expressiveness to grow and evolve with the needs of archetype developers.

This strategy represents a significant abstraction over the needs and usage of most
other simulator technologies. This level of detail is required by \cyclus due to the
dynamically loadable agents. Without a strong type system, state variables
would only be minimally useful and archetypes would have to rely on out-of-simulator
mechanisms to save and load their state.

\subsection{Metadata Annotations}

Metadata annotations are coupled with code generation.  State variable annotations
are provided by using the \code{#pragma cyclus var} directive. Annotations for
the archetypes as a whole are given using the \code{#pragma cyclus note} directive,
as specified in \S \ref{subsec-ppgc}. Both of these directives take a dictionary
as an argument and this mapping must have string keys.

Metadata serves an important purpose by communicating information to the \cyclus
preprocessor, to the \cyclus kernel, and even beyond the simulation to analysis
and visualization tools. Some metadata is automatically generated from the
archetype declaration itself.  This information is considered read-only and required.
Other annotations are supplied by the archetype developers and are optional.
Some keys, such as documentation, are highly recommended even though they
are optional.

Any key may be supplied to the annotation directives. For most keys, the
purpose of the entry is given entirely by the archetype developer. However,
some keys are reserved and have special meanings in various contexts. Table
\ref{sv-anno} lists these keys for state variable annotations and Table
\ref{ag-anno} displays the reserved keys for \code{#pragma cyclus note}.

With respect to \cycpp, metadata enables the customization of code generation
without the need to alter the preprocessor itself or create an entirely new
code generator. This tailoring of \cycpp is exemplified by keys, such as \code{'shape'},
\code{'schematype'}, and \code{'initfromcopy'}.  Still, other keys are generated by \cycpp itself
and are considered read-only.
These include the all-important \code{'type'}, \code{'index'}, \code{'name'}, and
\code{'parents'} keys.  The automatic
creation of these keys minimizes human transcription error for the most important
metadata. This is a core simplification of archetype development.

Metadata is similarly important for the \cyclus kernel. All metadata is
directly available via the \code{annotations()} member function, which returns
a \gls{JSON}
object (equivalent to a Python dictionary with string keys). Combined with the
auto-generated read-only keys from \cycpp, the metadata provides much needed
reflection to the archetypes.  Unlike most C++ classes, archetypes have
runtime access to their own class names, their parent classes, and the names and
types of their state member variables. Therefore, the archetype may
make runtime decisions about how to behave based on how it is defined.
The major current use for the limited reflection in archetypes is for agents to
save and load themselves.

Lastly, metadata is useful beyond \cyclus itself. Annotation keys such as \code{'doc'},
\code{'tooltip'}, and \code{'units'} are included to provide end-user documentation.
The \code{'userlevel'}
and other keys signal how archetypes and state variables should be treated in
downstream user interfaces
Even keys, such as \code{'default'},
that might have a primary usage elsewhere
may still be helpful beyond the scope of \cyclus kernel.

The \code{#pragma cyclus var} and \code{#pragma cyclus note} directives provide
unambiguous locations for implementing and
generating metadata annotations. Metadata being contained completely within archetype
declarations increases the worth of both the metadata and the archetypes
because there is a single source for information about archetypes.
Additionally, this high degree of locality eases the creation of
archetypes, enabled by the automatic discovery of the annotation keys.

\subsection{Validation}

When writing \cyclus input files, users configure archetypes into prototypes.
Configuration is done by assigning all state variables to
initial values. This is the principal mechanism by which information flows
from users to archetype developers. Therefore, it is reasonable for archetype
developers to ask, ``Does what the user gave me make sense?'' For example:

\begin{itemize}
    \item a flux state variable should not be negative
    \item an integer variable should not receive the string ``Toaster''
    \item a vector representing an N-group cross-section should have exactly N
          elements
\end{itemize}
If the user were to not follow these rules, the input file would be break physical
constraints, type constraints, or shape constraints, respectively.
Such breaking of constraints must be an error and the simulation should not be
allowed to run.
These rules can be codified into the archetypes allowing
the simulator to check that whether or not any input file adheres to the
given constraints. This is known as \emph{validation} and \cyclus implements
it automatically to the extent possible. Input file validation occurs prior
to any simulation.


\Cyclus input files are written in \gls{XML}, which  may be validated against a
known structure called a \emph{schema}. The schema is itself \gls{XML} that describes
the layout, types, and attributes of the input it will validate.
\Cyclus provides a default schema that describes the overall structure of the
input file.

Archetypes, however, are dynamically loaded and so schema for their state
variables may not be predicted or preloaded. To ensure consistency, archetype schema
must be loaded along with the archetype itself.  It may be tempting to ignore the
notion of archetype schema and not validate the state variables.
Howevere, this would
create a system where there is no contract between the
user and the archetype developer. Even if an archetype developer implemented
\emph{ad hoc} validation to their own classes, users would not
anticipate such
restrictions.  To avoid this, \cyclus requires
that archetypes provide their own validation via the \code{schema()} member
function seen in Listing \ref{req-api}.

To accomplish the
above, the schemas must be written in a schema language, which happens to be a
subset of \gls{XML}. Thus the schema interface is two steps removed from the C++ that
defines the archetypes.
This provides additional
cognitive load to the archetype developer as they now must learn two additional
tools before writing an archetype. However, the schema for most state
variables may be derived automatically from information known to the preprocessor:
the name of the state variable, its type, and optionally its shape and size in
the case of containers. Thus the \code{schema()} member function is auto-generated
by \cycpp and input validation is obtained for free.

\gls{XML}-based schema are extraordinarily useful as a mechanism for validating types.
For example, if the user provides a floating point number rather than an
expected string, they should be alerted to this error immediately.
Moreover, schema can also validate structure to assert that
a variable has the right shape. A length-5 vector must be initialized with
five elements.

However, semantic and physical meaning must be ascribed by the archetype developer.
Giving meaning to state variables based
on their name and C++ type alone is impossible to accomplish via an automated
method. For example, that a variable named \code{flux}
on a \code{Reactor} should not be negative comes from a physical understanding
and not a computational one. Such meaning can and should be given by the
archetype developer via metadata.

Metadata for physical validation amounts to modifications of the schema. There are
two annotation keys that may be used to accomplish this.  The first clarifies the
type that the schema uses and is called \code{'schematype'}.
In the example of a group structure shown in Listing \ref{ngroups}, the
\code{'schematype'} could be assigned a value of
\code{'positiveInteger'} rather than relying on the default \code{'int'} type
that permits negatives and zeros. Additionally, the metadata key \code{'schema'}
can be used to wholly replace the auto-generated schema for the state variable at
hand. This key can be used to change the name of the state variable with respect
to the schema or to make a variable optional.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Physical Constraint Addition via `schematype'}, label=ngroups]
#pragma cyclus var {'schematype': 'positiveInteger'}
int ngroups;
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, \Cyclus also allows for the circumvention of automatic schema generation. This
provides another method for instilling semantic meaning into state variable annotations
that does not rely on metadata annotations, although
partial or complete circumvention of code generation will require
more effort from the archetype developer. The fine-grained control afforded by
hand-writing the \code{schema()} member function is performed
by advanced developers and only when absolutely necessary due to insufficiencies
in \cycpp.

\subsection{Model Location}

In a robust ecosystem of archetypes, it is nearly guaranteed that different archetype
developers will want to use the same name. No single person or organization can
reasonably lay sole claim to generic terms such as \emph{reactor}, \emph{source},
\emph{sink}, and other names. Simultaneously, the archetype developer should not
be concerned with accidental name collision between their archetypes and archetypes
of other
past, present, and future developers.  Furthermore, it is often useful in a
simulation or
development campaign to group similar or related archetypes together. Uniqueness
and collection problems are simultaneously solved through a hardy \emph{package system}.

\cyclus packaging is an organizational structure that defines where on the file system
archetypes are installed to, how the \cyclus kernel will load installed
packages, and how to uniquely identify an archetype in an input file.  Archetypes
are denoted with a three-part \emph{archetype specification}. When spelled out, this
is a colon-separated string with the following elements:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a slash-separated (\texttt{/}) directory path,
    \item a library name, and
    \item an archetype name.
\end{enumerate}
For example, \code{my/path:mylib:MyAgent} represents \code{MyAgent} living
in \code{mylib} residing in the \code{'my/path'} directory. More than just
a simple spelling convention, this is a necessary
tool for searching for and discovering archetypes on the machine of the user.

The path portion of the specification is relative to the \code{CYCLUS_PATH}. This is
an list of directories on the machine that will be searched in order to find the
archetype of interest. By default, \code{CYCLUS_PATH} contains the current working
directory, the \cyclus install directory, and the \cyclus build directory.
\code{CYCLUS_PATH} may also be modified as an environment variable, allowing the user
to permanently or temporarily alter the \cyclus search behavior.  Thus the path
specification (e.g. \code{'my/path'}) is interpreted as a sub-directory of all of
the directories on the \code{CYCLUS_PATH}. For a directory \code{d1} on
\code{CYCLUS_PATH}, if  \code{'d1/my/path'} does not exist then the search for
the archetype will continue along with \code{d2}, and so on. The path portion
may be an empty string, indicating that the library lives directly on the
\code{CYCLUS_PATH}.

The library name is the dynamically loadable library file name that stores the
archetype. This does not include the \code{lib-} prefix or the file extension,
which is generally operating system-dependent.  For example, on a
POSIX system,
a file named \code{libmyagents.so} would receive the library name \code{myagents}
in the archetype specification.
If a library name is not specified, then it is assumed to be the same as the
archetype name.
If desired, a single path may hold many libraries and a single library may hold
many archetypes. Thus, archetypes may be grouped
together coarsely or finely, depending on the needs of the archetype developers.

The path and library names together allow for complete disambiguation of
archetypes because they enforce an important degree of namespacing.  It is unlikely
that two well-designed libraries will overlap in both library and archetype name.
Even if they overlap, one or both libraries may be placed in respective
sub-directories and the path is used to establish uniqueness.
This strategy for specifying archetypes ultimately removes confusion and error from
both archetype developers and users alike.

\subsection{Markets are not Agents}

In early versions of \cyclus, the dynamic resource exchange algorithm that the
kernel used was itself dynamically loadable. Such an algorithm was called a
\emph{market} and was categorized as an entity alongside regions,
institutions, and facilities.
Each commodity was traded in its own market, which was specified by
the user in the input file.

Unlike the other entities, though, a market did not have agency.  It could not
communicate with other agents in the simulation because it was itself the method
for agent communication.  Furthermore, resource exchange is the keystone
part of all fuel cycle simulators.
Relegating such algorithms to live outside of
the kernel lead to maintenance problems. It became difficult to
ensure that all markets correctly supported the proper exchange interface,
thus minimizing the value of modularity within \cyclus.

Therefore, the notion of markets as a simulation entity was removed. In their
stead, dynamic resource exchange algorithms were brought into the core to
guarantee exchange feasibility \cite{Gidden2016}. Moreover, this enabled all commodities to trade
through a single global exchange. The commodity itself automatically defines
the sub-exchange graph in which the commodity participates.
These sub-exchange graphs may be thought of as analogous to the
markets, which were removed in order to simplify archetype development.
Since markets did not initially have any agency, their removal did not
affect the agent-based
nature of \cyclus.  Rather, market removal allowed archetypes to
communicate through a common resource exchange interface.

In summary, the current interpretation of dynamic resource exchange
eases the burden on archetype developers. Because the primary duty of the
kernel is to provide generic and valid resource exchange algorithms,
the archetype developer is not required to construct a custom exchange for
each commodity an archetype trades. Furthermore, market removal from the
kernel does not
impinge on exchange solver availability or customization.  Many exchanges may
be provided via user-tuneable parameters.  The only restriction
is that the exchange algorithms must exist within \cyclus itself.  This is not
